This is the tabutils firefox add-on.

Probably only useful to myself.. ;-)

It provides a simple toolbar button that shows the current number of tabs in
a window or a tab group. If the tab group has a title it gets displayed in the
tooltip.

The plugin is based on the addon-sdk-1.6.1.

* `cfx run` to test the plugin
* `cfx xpi` to build the xpi file
